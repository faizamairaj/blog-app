      title: 'Getting Started with Typescript', 
      content:` TypeScript is a statically typed, compiled superset of JavaScript that enables developers to write more reliable and scalable code. By introducing optional type annotations and type inference, TypeScript helps catch errors during development, which would typically only be identified during runtime in JavaScript. This enhances the development process by improving code quality, enabling better tooling support like autocompletion and refactoring, and making it easier to understand and maintain large codebases. TypeScript compiles down to standard JavaScript, making it compatible with any JavaScript environment, and can be integrated with existing JavaScript projects, providing an incremental path to adopting types in code. As a result, TypeScript has become a popular choice for building modern web applications and complex systems.`,

      content: `Building a type-safe full-stack application with GraphQL Codegen involves leveraging the power of GraphQL and TypeScript to ensure seamless communication between the front-end and back-end. GraphQL Codegen automates the process of generating TypeScript types based on GraphQL queries, mutations, and schemas. By integrating GraphQL Codegen into your development workflow, you can avoid manual type definitions and ensure that the types remain consistent across your application. This leads to better development efficiency, reduced runtime errors, and a more maintainable codebase, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than managing type mismatches. The process typically includes configuring GraphQL Codegen, generating the necessary types for both the client and server, and utilizing those types in your application to provide strong type-checking, autocompletion, and documentation.`,
